A new three-year "multi-omic" study investigating the roles played by microbes and their interactions with the human body.  Using inflammatory bowel disease as our focus, this project will delve into the relationship between the microbiome and disease.

The cells of the human body are outnumbered ten to one by bacteria, but large-scale surveys of the human microbiome were not feasible until the advent of next-generation sequencing. The first stage of the Human Microbiome Project sampled 300 healthy subjects to determine normal microbial composition of healthy Americans (which microbial species were there), their biochemical function (what the microbes were doing), and microbial variation both between individuals and over time. Now that we have determined the healthy human microbiome, the next stage of the Human Microbiome project is to understand how the microbiome changes in and contributes toward disease. 
<p>
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes both Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (CD), affects approximately 1.5 million Americans and is one of the most-studied imbalances between microbes and the immune system. The relationship was first observed in the clinic, when doctors noted that both CD and UC often responded to antibiotics. This connection was bolstered when scientists learned to make mice that were genetically predisposed to developing IBD, (such as those missing the interleukin 10 gene) and observed that these mice would only develop IBD if they were raised in normal conditions, but remained IBD-free if they were raised germ-free. When scientists began to study the gut bacteria of IBD patients, they noticed several changes, or dysbioses. Many studies found that Crohn’s disease was associated with less biodiversity, more Enterobacteriaceae, and fewer beneficial Clostridia. It was less clear whether these changes were causing IBD, microbial adaptations to IBD, or perhaps both.
<p>
The IBD multi’omic database is a new three-year effort led by Ramnik Xavier and Curtis Huttenhower, which will integrate many different types of data to understand how the human gut microbiome changes over the course of inflammatory bowel disease. Clinical data for this initiative will come from Massachusetts General Hospital, Emory University Hospital, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. A multidisciplinary team of experts will contribute to analysis, including researchers from Baylor College of Medicine (viral genomics), Washington University (epithelial stem cells), UCLA (proteomics), Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories (proteomics), The University of Colorado (computational analysis), and The Broad Institute (single-cell techniques, genomics, and metabolite profiling). Integrating these different data types will allow us to understand not only which microbes are present, but to observe their metabolic actions (and changes in metabolism) in real time, as well as considering how this metabolism affects their human hosts.
