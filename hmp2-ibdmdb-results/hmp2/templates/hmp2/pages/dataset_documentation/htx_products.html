                Transcripts were aligned to hg19 using topHat v2.0.14 and then resolved to counts using htseq-count version 0.6.1.
                Sample quality was assessed on the basis of percentages of tags mapping to exonic vs non exonic regions. If the percent 
                of reads mapping to a non-exonic region was > 40% it was considered a QC fail. 

                Distributed in TSV and BIOM formats.
