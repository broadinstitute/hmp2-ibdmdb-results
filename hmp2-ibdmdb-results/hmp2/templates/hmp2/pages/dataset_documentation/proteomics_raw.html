                Data were acquired using  LC-MS/MS systems (Thermo Scientific Q-Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer; UCLA) 
                Precursor MS spectra were collected over 400â€“2000 m/z, followed by data-dependent
                MS/MS spectra of the twelve most abundant ions, using a collision energy of 30%. A dynamic
                exclusion time of 30 s was used to discriminate against previously analyzed ions.
