            <p>
                Samples were analyzed for expression of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), 
                anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae mannan antibodies (ASCA), anti-OmpC, and anti-CBir1 by ELISA.
                Antibody levels were determined and the results expressed as ELISA units (EU/mL), which are 
                relative to laboratory standards consisting of pooled, antigen reactive sera from of patients
                with well-characterized disease.
