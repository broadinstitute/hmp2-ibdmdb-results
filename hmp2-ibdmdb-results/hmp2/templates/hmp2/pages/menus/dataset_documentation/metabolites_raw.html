            <h4>File Descriptions</h4>
            <h5>Raw Files</h5>
            <p>
                Data were acquired using LC-MS systems comprised of Nexera X2 U-HPLC systems
                (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments; Marlborough, MA) coupled to Q Exactive/Exactive Plus orbitrap mass
                spectrometers (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Waltham, MA). MS analyses were carried out using electrospray ionization 
                in the negative ion mode using full scan analysis over m/z 70-850 at 70,000 resolution and 3 Hz data acquisition 
                rate.
            </p>
            <h5>Inventory Files</h5>
            <p>
                In order to standardize within and across batches “nearest neighbor” scaling was done using the nearest
                flanking pooled stool samples, unless otherwise stated under the “Ref.to.use” column of the attached permethod
                sample inventories. 
            </p>
            <h5>NN_MN Files</h5>
            <p>
                Owing to differences in water content and heterogeneity among stool
                samples, median scaling was conducted in a per-metabolite per-method basis using the total signal
                median for each sample in each method. The data deposited has been median-scaled this way, however,
                non-median scaled data is accessible in the compressed raw data folder for each method. After “nearest
                neighbor” scaling the suffix “NN” is appended to the dataset names and “MN” to the median-scaled ones.

            <h4>Methods</h4>
            <h5>C18-neg</h5>
            <p> MS analyses were carried out using electrospray ionization in the negative ion mode using full scan analysis
                over m/z 70-850 at 70,000 resolution and 3 Hz data acquisition rate. Additional MS settings are: ion spray
                voltage, -3.5 kV; capillary temperature, 320°C; probe heater temperature, 300 °C; sheath gas, 45; auxiliary
                gas, 10; and S-lens RF level 60.</p>

            <h5>C8-pos</h5>
            <p>MS analyses were carried out using electrospray ionization in the positive ion mode using full scan analysis
                over m/z 200-1100 at 70,000 resolution and 3 Hz data acquisition rate.</p>

            <h5>HILIC-neg</h5>
            <p>MS analyses were carried out using electrospray ionization in the negative ion mode using full scan analysis
                over m/z 60-750 at 70,000 resolution and 3 Hz data acquisition rate.</p>

            <h5>HILIC-pos</h5>
            <p>MS analyses were carried out using electrospray ionization in the positive ion mode using full scan analysis
                over m/z 70-800 at 70,000 resolution and 3 Hz data acquisition rate.</p>
