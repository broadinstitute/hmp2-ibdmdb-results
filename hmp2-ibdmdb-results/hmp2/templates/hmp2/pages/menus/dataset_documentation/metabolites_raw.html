            <h4>C18-neg</h4>
            <p> MS analyses were carried out using electrospray ionization in the negative ion mode using full scan analysis
                over m/z 70-850 at 70,000 resolution and 3 Hz data acquisition rate. Additional MS settings are: ion spray
                voltage, -3.5 kV; capillary temperature, 320°C; probe heater temperature, 300 °C; sheath gas, 45; auxiliary
                gas, 10; and S-lens RF level 60.</p>

            <h4>C8-pos</h4>
            <p>MS analyses were carried out using electrospray ionization in the positive ion mode using full scan analysis
                over m/z 200-1100 at 70,000 resolution and 3 Hz data acquisition rate.</p>

            <h4>HILIC-neg</h4>
            <p>MS analyses were carried out using electrospray ionization in the negative ion mode using full scan analysis
                over m/z 60-750 at 70,000 resolution and 3 Hz data acquisition rate.</p>

            <h4>HILIC-pos</h4>
